x-http
x-method (do we need it ? if POST /page/)
x-target
x-swap
x-trigger
x-indicator (or x-loader)
x-headers
x-data (or x-body or x-json, I want to be able to use x-http with FORM, JSON and HTML)



x-swap: needs... before, after, outer

x-trigger: loop:300, time:300, repeat:300, load:300 (repeating)

x-json/x-body I am not likings... seems tricky to end user.



	•	click / submit / input:300 / change:300 → event + debounce
	•	load → run once after element is processed
	•	load:300 → run once after 300ms
	•	every:300 → repeat every 300ms (setInterval) or maybe "interval:300" ?
